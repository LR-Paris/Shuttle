To add a fallback image for missing photos:

1. Place your cat photo (or any fallback image) in this public folder
2. Name it: fallback-image.png
3. The system will automatically show this image when a product photo is missing

The fallback image should ideally be:
- PNG, JPG, or WebP format
- Square aspect ratio (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels)
- Clear and professional looking
